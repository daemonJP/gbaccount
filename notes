Interesting memory locations

$3d: men left
$3e: backpack power percentage (BCD)
$51-$53: starting dollar value (BCD)
$57-$59: current dollar value (BCD)
$5a-$5b: city energy (BCD with low digits first)
$5c: car type (0-3)
$62: number of items currently held
$69: ghost bait remaining (starts at 5)
$6a: number of traps
$6b: number of empty traps
$6c: if you have the PLCS, this increments with each ghost captured until 10,
    then traps are used, reset when going back to base
$6d: bitmap of non-trap items:
    $1 pk energy detector
    $2 image intensifier
    $4 marshmallow sensor
    $8 ghost bait
    $20 ghost vacuum
    $40 portable laser confinement system
$6e: house we're visiting
$c8-$db: house statuses starting at the top and working left to right (houses
    on the left and right edges aren't "live")
    house high nybble goes through $0-$f over time, when it rolls over the low
    nybble goes through $4, $c, $f, then back to $0. low nybble of $f shows as
    red and has ghost. If you get near a house with a low nybble of $c and have
    the pk energy detector it'll promote to $f (with ghost) and reset the high
    nybble to 0. If you get near a house with a low nybble of $4 and have the
    pk energy detector it'll change to $5 while nearby and show as purple. The
    high nybble is used to index into score table when ghost is captured. The
    faster it is captured (lower number) the more money is awarded.
